```
As the user,
I need a list of bookmarks,
So that I can view the list of bookmarks.
```
![Bookmark model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsankhalpara/bookmark_manager/master/bookmark_list_model.jpg)
* When the user clicks on /bookmarks it creates a gets request to the controller.
* The controller calls the .list method from bookmark.rb model.
* The model sends back the bookmark array.
* The controller sends the array to bookmarks.erb.
* The view sends back HTML to the controller.
* The controller then sends the HTML response back to the user.
